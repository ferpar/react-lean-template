### Basic React Template for educational purposes:

Keep in mind:

Your basic React App will need the folowing three files: 

- index.html --> put it inside the "/public" folder so webpack finds it.
- index.js   --> this will include your ReactDOM.render() method which injects the app into the index.html
- App.js     --> this is your root component, it will be exported to index.js
