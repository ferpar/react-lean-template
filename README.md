### Basic React Template for educational purposes:

Keep in mind:

Your basic React App will need the folowing three files: 

-index.html --> put inside /public folder so webpack finds it.
-index.js   --> this will include your ReactDOM.render() method which injects the app in the index.html
-App.js     --> this is your root component, it will be exported to index.js
