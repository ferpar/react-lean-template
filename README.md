### Basic React Template for educational purposes:

Keep in mind:

Create both a "/public", "/dist", and "/src" folders.

Your basic React App will need the folowing three files: 

- /public/index.html --> this will need to contain a script pointing at the bundle.js created via webpack.
- /src/index.js   --> this will include your ReactDOM.render() method which injects the app into the index.html
- /src/App.js     --> this is your root component, it will be exported to index.js
